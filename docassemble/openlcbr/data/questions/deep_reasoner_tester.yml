question: docassemble-openlcbr Reasoner Tester
subquestion: |
  This tool will allow you to test the strength of your docassemble-openlcbr reasoner.
  
  You will be asked to upload the reasoner.  The reasoner will then be used to predict
  the outcome of each of the cases in its database of precedents, using the rest of
  the precedent cases for comparison. You will be provided with a score indicating the
  percentage of cases in the database which the reasoner correctly predicts.
