question: docassemble-openlcbr demo
subquestion: |
  This website is a demonstration of the docassemble-openlcbr package being developed
  by Jason Morris of Round Table Law as an ABA Innovation Fellowship project for
  2018/2019.  The fellowship is sponsored by Clio.
  
  The project is to take openlcbr, which is an open-source tool for
  legal case-based reasoning written by Matthias Grabmair, and to implement it as a
  extension to docassemble.
  
  Docassemble is a leading open-source legal expert system and document automation
  platform written by Jonathan Pyle.
  
  The purpose of the project is to explore whether it is possible to use
  reasoning-by-analogy to extend the capabilities of legal expert systems to
  include answering open-textured legal questions.
  
  Click below to continue and see the output of the system, which is generated
  in real time by docassemble-openlcbr.
